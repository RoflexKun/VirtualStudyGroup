## Project Overview
This project simulates the interaction between a server and multiple students who need a space to share, communicate, and collaborate on different projects. It features a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with Qt, a **login/register system**, and a way to see other users who are online.

---

## Technologies Used
Since this was my biggest solo project so far, I chose technologies that made development easier:

- **CMake** ‚Äì Simplifies compiling a project that uses a graphical library like Qt.
- **Qt (Graphic Library)** ‚Äì A user-friendly GUI library that streamlined development, especially for UI resizing.
- **JSON Files** ‚Äì Used for safely storing and modifying real-time data such as users and shared files.

---

## Communication Protocol
The most crucial feature of this project is **sending and receiving files**. To ensure reliable communication without data loss, the server implements a **TCP protocol**, which is designed specifically for such scenarios.

---

## Features

### Server Connection & Login
Before accessing the application, users must **connect to the server**. The server acts as the backend, processing user requests and returning results. After connecting, users must **log in or register** to interact with others.

### Chat Room
The chat system consists of three main sections:
- **Active Users** ‚Äì Displays currently online users in real-time.
- **Chat Log** ‚Äì Shows past messages.
- **Send a Message** ‚Äì Allows users to send messages, which are stored in a JSON file.

### File Management
Users can upload and download files from a **cloud-like system** hosted on the server.

- **To download a file:** Click on the file and press the download button. The file will be saved in the `Downloads` folder.
- **To upload a file:** Click the upload button and enter the file path.

### Live Collaboration
This feature was initially meant to support **real-time file modifications**, but due to bugs and time constraints, it was revised. Now, users can:

- **See who is working on the same file.**
- **Receive notifications** when modifications are made.
- **Sync (Pull)** the latest version from the server.
- **Push (Upload)** a modified version to the server (similar to Git's push/pull system).

## Disclaimer
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This project was initially designed to run on my local machine. Paths are hardcoded for my setup, so modifications may be needed to run it on other machines.

üìù This project was developed for the **Computer Networks** course at UAIC Faculty of Computer Science.
