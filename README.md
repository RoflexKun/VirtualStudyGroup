# VirtualStudyGroup (aka StudyBuddy)

## Very small description of the project
This project simulates the interaction between a server and multiple students that need a space to share, communicate and collaborate on different projects. I created this project as a little application, with a GUI (created using Qt), a login/register menu and the possibility to check other users who are online the same time as you so you know who is doing the project... or not.
